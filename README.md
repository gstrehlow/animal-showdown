## Installation <a id="installation"></a>

### After cloning the code from the [Repo](https://github.com/gstockha/group-project-ii/pull/31), the user should install npm, using npm i on the command line, and installing bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, and sequelize. Then run mysql -u root -p on the command line to source db/schema.sql . Then on the command line use npm run seeds. Finally, create a .env and input the DB_USER, DB_NAME, and DB_PW. Of course, a .gitignore is always a good idea. Run npm start in the terminal to start a server and run the localhost:3001 in the browser.
